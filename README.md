Practice of File Input &amp; Output in Python

File Handling in Python 

Today I revised and practiced File Input & Output in Python.

This mini practice helped me clearly understand:
- Difference between text files & binary files
- How data is stored in files (bits: 0 & 1)
- File modes: `r`, `w`, `a`, `r+`, `w+`, `a+`
- Reading data using `read()` and `readline()`
- Writing and appending data into files
- How file cursor works while reading/writing

This practice improved my understanding of how Python interacts with
real-world data stored in files.

✨ Learning Python step by step.
